# Residential-and-Commercial-Energy-Cost

📘 Project Overview

This project provides insights into building characteristics, occupancy levels, and monthly energy costs to understand how various factors influence energy consumption.
The goal is to analyze energy usage patterns across different building types and locations to optimize resource allocation, improve energy efficiency, and support data-driven decision-making.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze energy consumption patterns for residential and commercial buildings.

Identify the key drivers of energy usage (e.g., building size, region, occupancy).

Build a predictive model to estimate monthly energy consumption.

Provide actionable insights for optimizing energy efficiency programs.

🤖 Modeling Approach

This is a regression problem, where the target variable is energy_consumption_kwh or monthly_energy_cost.
